      The following chapter can be sometimes a bit hard to get through.
            Persist and finish it; deployment is an important part of the
            website development process. This chapter is placed in the middle of
            the tutorial so that your mentor can help with the slightly trickier
            process of getting your website online. This means you can still
            finish the tutorial on your own if you run out of time.

     Until now, your website was only available on your computer. Now you
          will learn how to deploy it! Deploying is the process of publishing
          your application on the Internet so people can finally go and see your
          app. :)
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     As you learned, a website has to be located on a server. There are a
          lot of server providers available on the internet, we're going to use
     <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">
      PythonAnywhere
     </a>
     . PythonAnywhere is free for small applications that don't have too
          many visitors so it'll definitely be enough for you now.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     The other external service we'll be using is
     <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">
      GitHub
     </a>
     , which is a code hosting service. There are others out there, but
          almost all programmers have a GitHub account these days, and now so
          will you!
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     These three places will be important to you. Your local computer will
          be the place where you do development and testing. When you're happy
          with the changes, you will place a copy of your program on GitHub.
          Your website will be on PythonAnywhere and you will update it by
          getting a new copy of your code from GitHub.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     The deployment process can be illustrated as follows:

     Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. This
          software can track changes to files over time so that you can recall
          specific versions later. A bit like the "track changes" feature in
          word processor programs (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer),
          but much more powerful.

            meaning that we'll use separate databases for your local testing
            site and your live website on PythonAnywhere. The PythonAnywhere
            database could be SQLite, like your development machine, but usually
            you will use one called MySQL which can deal with a lot more site
            visitors than SQLite. Either way, by ignoring your SQLite database
            for the GitHub copy, it means that all of the posts and superuser
            you created so far are going to only be available locally, and
            you'll have to create new ones on production. You should think of
            your local database as a good playground where you can test
            different things and not be afraid that you're going to delete your
            real posts from your blog.

      PythonAnywhere is based on Linux, so if you're on Windows, the
            console will look a little different from the one on your computer.
            Deploying a web app on PythonAnywhere involves pulling down your
            code from GitHub, and then configuring PythonAnywhere to recognise
            it and start serving it as a web application. There are manual ways
            of doing it, but PythonAnywhere provides a helper tool that will do
            it all for you. Let's install it first:
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     PythonAnywhere command-line
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <pre class="calibre13"><code class="calibre11">$ pip3.10 install --user pythonanywhere
        </code></pre>
    <p class="calibre6">
     That should print out some things like
     <code class="calibre11">
      Collecting pythonanywhere
     </code>
     , and eventually end with a line saying
     <code class="calibre11">
      Successfully installed (...) pythonanywhere- (...)
     </code>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Now we run the helper to automatically configure our app from GitHub.
          Type the following into the console on PythonAnywhere (don't forget to
          use your GitHub username in place of
     <code class="calibre11">
      &lt;your-github-username&gt;
     </code>
     , so that the URL matches the clone URL from GitHub):
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     PythonAnywhere command-line
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <pre class="calibre13"><code class="calibre11">$ pa_autoconfigure_django.py --python=3.10 https://github.com/&lt;your-github-username&gt;/my-first-blog.git
        </code></pre>
    <p class="calibre6">
     As you watch that running, you'll be able to see what it's doing:
    </p>
    <ul class="calibre9">
     <li class="calibre3">
      Downloading your code from GitHub
     </li>
     <li class="calibre3">
      Creating a virtualenv on PythonAnywhere, just like the one on your
            own computer
     </li>
     <li class="calibre3">
      Updating your settings file with some deployment settings
     </li>
     <li class="calibre3">
      Setting up a database on PythonAnywhere using the
      <code class="calibre11">
       manage.py migrate
      </code>
      command
     </li>
     <li class="calibre3">
      Setting up your static files (we'll learn about these later)
     </li>
     <li class="calibre3">
      And configuring PythonAnywhere to serve your web app via its API
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="calibre6">
     On PythonAnywhere all those steps are automated, but they're the same
          steps you would have to go through with any other server provider.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     The main thing to notice right now is that your database on
          PythonAnywhere is actually totally separate from your database on your
          own computer, so it can have different posts and admin accounts. As a
          result, just as we did on your own computer, we need to initialize the
          admin account with
     <code class="calibre11">
      createsuperuser
     </code>
     . PythonAnywhere has automatically activated your virtualenv for you,
          so all you need to do is run:
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     PythonAnywhere command-line
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <pre class="calibre13"><code class="calibre11">(ola.pythonanywhere.com) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        </code></pre>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Type in the details for your admin user. Best to use the same ones as
          you're using on your own computer to avoid any confusion, unless you
          want to make the password on PythonAnywhere more secure.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Now, if you like, you can also take a look at your code on
          PythonAnywhere using
     <code class="calibre11">
      ls
     </code>
     :
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     PythonAnywhere command-line
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
    </p>
    <pre class="calibre13"><code class="calibre11">(ola.pythonanywhere.com) $ ls
        blog  db.sqlite3  manage.py  mysite requirements.txt static
        (ola.pythonanywhere.com) $ ls blog/
        __init__.py  __pycache__  admin.py  apps.py  migrations  models.py
        tests.py  views.py
        </code></pre>
    <p class="calibre6">
     You can also go to the "Files" page and navigate around using
          PythonAnywhere's built-in file browser. (From the Console page, you
          can get to other PythonAnywhere pages from the menu button in the
          upper right corner. Once you're on one of the pages, there are links
          to the other ones near the top.)

    </p>
    <ul class="calibre9">
     <li class="calibre3">
      Forgetting to create your PythonAnywhere API token.

      If you see an error saying
      <em class="calibre14">
       "Could not find your settings.py"
      </em>
      , it's probably because you didn't manage to add all your files to
            Git, and/or you didn't push them up to GitHub successfully. Have
            another look at the Git section above
     </li>
     <li class="calibre3">
      If you previously signed up for a PythonAnywhere account and had an
            error with collectstatic, you probably have an older version of
            SQLite (eg 3.8.2) for your account. In that case, sign up for a new
            account and try the commands in the PythonAnywhere section above.

    <p class="calibre6">
     If you see an error when you try to visit your site, the first place

    </h2>
    <p class="calibre6">
     The default page for your site should say "It worked!", just like it
          does on your local computer. Try adding
     <code class="calibre11">
      /admin/
     </code>
     to the end of the URL, and you'll be taken to the admin site. Log in
          with the username and password, and you'll see you can add new Posts
          on the server -- remember, the posts from your local test database
          were not sent to your live blog.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Once you have a few posts created, you can go back to your local setup
          (not PythonAnywhere). From here you should work on your local setup to
          make changes. This is a common workflow in web development – make
          changes locally, push those changes to GitHub, and pull your changes
          down to your live Web server. This allows you to work and experiment
          without breaking your live Web site. Pretty cool, huh?

    <p class="calibre6">
     Give yourself a
     <em class="calibre14">
      HUGE
     </em>
     pat on the back! Server deployments are one of the trickiest parts of
          web development and it often takes people several days before they get
          them working. But you've got your site live, on the real Internet!
