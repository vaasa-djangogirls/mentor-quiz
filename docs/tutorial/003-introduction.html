     Welcome
    </h2>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Welcome to the Django Girls Tutorial! We are happy to see you here. :)
          In this tutorial, we will take you on a journey under the hood of web
          technologies, offering you a glimpse of all the bits and pieces that
          need to come together to make the web work as we know it.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     As with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no
          worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be
          just fine. :)
    </p>
    <h2 class="calibre7" id="introduction">
     Introduction
    </h2>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Have you ever felt that the world is more and more about technology to
          which you cannot (yet) relate? Have you ever wondered how to create a
          website but have never had enough motivation to start? Have you ever
          thought that the software world is too complicated for you to even try
          doing something on your own?
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Well, we have good news for you! Programming is not as hard as it
          seems and we want to show you how fun it can be.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     This tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer. If you
          want to be good at it, you need months or even years of learning and
          practice. But we want to show you that programming or creating
          websites is not as complicated as it seems. We will try to explain
          different bits and pieces as well as we can, so you will not feel
          intimidated by technology.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     We hope that we'll be able to make you love technology as much as we
          do!
    </p>
    <h2 class="calibre7" id="what-will-you-learn-during-the-tutorial">
     What will you learn during the tutorial?
    </h2>
    <p class="calibre6">
     Once you've finished the tutorial, you will have a small working web
          application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so
          others will see your work!
    </p>
    <p class="calibre6">
     It will (more or less) look like this:

     It is amazing to take part in a Django Girls workshop, but we are
          aware that it is not always possible to attend one. This is why we
          encourage you to try following this tutorial at home. For readers at
          home, we are currently preparing videos that will make it easier to
          follow the tutorial on your own. It is still a work in progress, but
          more and more things will be covered soon at the

          correct video.
